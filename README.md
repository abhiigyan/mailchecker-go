# mailchecker-go


A Golang email checker is a software tool or function developed using the Go programming language that verifies the validity and existence of an email address. By leveraging the built-in features and packages available in Golang, such as net/smtp and net/mail, an email checker can perform various checks on an email address. These checks may include syntax validation to ensure the email address follows the proper format, domain verification to ensure the domain exists and has valid DNS records, and even SMTP server communication to validate the existence of the email address on the recipient server. With its efficiency and concurrency support, Golang enables the development of robust and high-performance email checkers that can be integrated into larger applications or used as standalone tools for verifying email addresses with ease and accuracy.
